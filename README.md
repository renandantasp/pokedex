Currently, the application contains:

- a individual page for each pokémon displaying its artwork, base stats, types, resistances and weaknesses.

In a near future the **DEX** will also contain a *evolution chart* on each capable of evoling pokémon's page containing its evolution tree, and also a feature called *Teams* for the user to create his own team and analyse its weaknesses and advantages.
