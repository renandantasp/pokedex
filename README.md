# DEX


Hosted on [pokedexdex](https://pokedexdex.herokuapp.com), **DEX** is a simple pokedex application that displays data from the [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/).

It uses the [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/) framework to create the user interface, alongside [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/) for styling.

Currently, the application contains:
- a [homepage](https://pokedexdex.herokuapp.com) with a list of all pokémons alongside a search bar;
- a individual page for each pokémon displaying its artwork, base stats, types, resistances and weaknesses.

In a near future the **DEX** will also contain a *evolution chart* on each capable of evoling pokémon's page containing its evolution tree, and also a feature called *Teams* for the user to create his own team and analyse its weaknesses and advantages.
